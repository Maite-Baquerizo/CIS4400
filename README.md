# Analysis Of Industrial Discharge - Facility Information
The purpose of this project is to define the information architecture for managing and analyzing industrial discharge and facility-related data. The architecture ensures logical grouping, metadata definitions, and relationships to support efficient data management.

## Business Requirements
Enable detailed tracking of facility-level compliance with regulatory measures.

Provide insights into environmental impacts through comprehensive data analysis.

Facilitate streamlined certification processes for industrial permits.

## Functional Requirements

Import, validate, and store facility data, including geographic and operational details.

Enable query and reporting capabilities for regulatory compliance tracking.

Provide visualization tools for environmental data analysis.

Automate certification record management, including timestamps and certifier details.

Ensure secure, role-based access to sensitive data categories.

## Data Requirements
### Data Selection Criteria

The dataset contains at least 10 columns and over 7500 rows.

Data is unaggregated, ensuring granularity for analysis.

Data is sourced independently of common repositories like Kaggle.


### Dataset Description

Columns: 41, covering regulatory, facility, environmental, and certification data.

Rows: Exceeds 7500, ensuring comprehensive coverage of industrial discharge data.

The data that I chose is from data.ca.gov <https://data.ca.gov/dataset/stormwater-regulatory-including-enforcement-actions-information-and-water-quality-results/resource/33e69394-83ec-4872-b644-b9f494de1824>
