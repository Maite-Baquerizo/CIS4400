1. Overview

The purpose of this document is to define the information architecture for managing and analyzing industrial discharge and facility-related data. The architecture ensures logical grouping, metadata definitions, and relationships to support efficient data management.

2. Core Entities

1. Regulatory Measures

Description: Represents permits and applications for industrial discharges.

Key Attributes:

PERMIT_TYPE: Type of permit or application (e.g., Industrial).

APP_ID: Unique identifier for the application.

WDID: Waste Discharge ID.

STATUS: Current status of the permit/application.

NOI_PROCESSED_DATE: Date when the Notice of Intent was processed.

NOT_EFFECTIVE_DATE: Date when the permit became ineffective.

2. Facility Information

Description: Details about facilities involved in industrial discharges.

Key Attributes:

Location:

FACILITY_NAME

FACILITY_ADDRESS

FACILITY_CITY, FACILITY_STATE, FACILITY_ZIP

FACILITY_LATITUDE, FACILITY_LONGITUDE

Ownership:

OPERATOR_NAME: Name of the operator.

FACILITY_CONTACT_FIRST_NAME, FACILITY_CONTACT_LAST_NAME: Contact person.

FACILITY_TITLE: Contact personâ€™s title.

FACILITY_PHONE, FACILITY_EMAIL

Size and Activity:

FACILITY_TOTAL_SIZE and FACILITY_TOTAL_SIZE_UNIT

FACILITY_AREA_ACTIVITY and FACILITY_AREA_ACTIVITY_UNIT

PERCENT_OF_SITE_IMPERVIOUSNESS

3. Environmental Information

Description: Tracks interactions between facilities and the environment.

Key Attributes:

RECEIVING_WATER_NAME: Name of the receiving water body.

INDIRECTLY / DIRECTLY: Modes of discharge.

PRIMARY_SIC, SECONDARY_SIC, TERTIARY_SIC: Standard Industry Classification codes.

4. Certification Details

Description: Information on permit certifications.

Key Attributes:

CERTIFIER_BY: Name of the certifier.

CERTIFIER_TITLE: Title of the certifier.

CERTIFICATION_DATE: Date of certification.

CERTIFICATION_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of the certification event.

5. Timestamps and Metadata

Description: Ensures traceability and version control.

Key Attributes:

NOI_PROCESSED_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp for NOI processing.

NOT_EFFECTIVE_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp for permit inactivation.

QUESTION_TMDL_ANSWER: Metadata on environmental considerations.

3. Data Relationships

Facility to Regulatory Measures

Relationship: Many-to-One

Details: Each facility can have multiple regulatory measures associated with it (e.g., different permits or applications).

Facility to Environmental Information

Relationship: One-to-Many

Details: A facility can interact with multiple receiving water bodies and may report different modes of discharge.

Facility to Certification

Relationship: One-to-One

Details: Each facility permit is certified by a designated individual, and this information is tracked uniquely.

4. Data Grouping and Access

Regulatory Data Group

Includes attributes such as PERMIT_TYPE, APP_ID, WDID, STATUS.

Access level: Regulatory officers and auditors.

Facility Data Group

Includes location, ownership, and size/activity details.

Access level: Facility operators, regional managers, and environmental consultants.

Environmental Data Group

Includes discharge modes and receiving water details.

Access level: Environmental analysts and researchers.

Certification Data Group

Includes certifier information and timestamps.

Access level: Legal and compliance teams.

5. Metadata Standards

Data Types:

text: For identifiers, names, and descriptive attributes.

timestamp: For date-time data.

numeric: For measurements and percentages.

Validation Rules:

All IDs must be unique.

Dates must follow the YYYY-MM-DD format.
